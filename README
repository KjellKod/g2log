HOW TO BUILD
===================
This g2log is a snapshot from KjellKod repository. 
It contains what is needed to build example, unit test and performance test of g2log. 

justthread C++11 thread library is no longer needed. 
On Windows it is enough to use Visual Studio 11  (2012)
On Linux it is enough to use gcc4.7. 
The CMakeFile.txt is updated to reflect that, the justthread parts is 
commented away in case someone still needs that.


If you want to integrate g2log in your own software you need 
the following files
g2log/src/
     g2log.cpp/h
     g2logworker.cpp/h
     crashhandler.h (crashhandler_win.cpp or crashhandler_unix.cpp)
     shared_queue.h
     active.h/cpp


BUILDING g2log: 
-----------
The default is to build an example binary 'g2log-FATAL'
I suggest you start with that, run it and view the created log also.

If you are interested in the performance or unit tests then you can 
enable the creation of them in the g2log/CMakeLists.txt file. See that file for more details

--- Building on Linux ---
cd g2log
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ..
make

--- Building on Windows ---
Please use the Visual Studio 11 (2012) command prompt "Developer command prompt"
cd g2log
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 11" ..
msbuild g2log_by_kjellkod.sln /p:Configuration=Release
Release\g2log-FATAL.exe


      
CONTENTS
===========================
3rdParty -- gtest, glog. 
-----------------------
Both are needed to compile the unit test and the logger comparison tests
Gtest must be unpacked before used, but it IS included by the CMake and you don't need to do install or compile it in any other way than through the g2log cmake setup.

glog is not included and must be installed if you want to run the comparison tests


About the Active Object
--------------------
Is made with standard C++ components with the help of the latest C++0x and std::thread features (thanks to justthread). For more details see www.kjellkod.cc/active-object-with-cpp0x. An example is provided. Other examples on pre C++0x Active Objects can also be found at www.kjellkod.cc (code page)

If you like it (or not) it would be nice with some feedback. That way 
I can improve g2log and it is also nice to see if someone is using it. 
If you have ANY questions or problems please do not hesitate in contacting
me on my blog http://kjellkod.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/kjellkods-g2log-vs-googles-glog-are-asynchronous-loggers-taking-over/

Good luck :)
